# Climate Change and CO2 Emission since 1900


I have created 4 maps for visualizing the climate change and CO2 emission since 1900

There are three that are about climate change.

The [first map](annual_temperature_map.html) is the yearly mean temperature of every country since 1900.

The [second map](january_temperature_map.html) is the temperature change of every January since 1900.

The [third map](decade_temperature_map.html) is the mean temperature of every decade since 1900.

And the [fourth map](emission_map.html) is the CO2 Emission of every country since 1749.
